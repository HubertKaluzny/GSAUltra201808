## 5 Across: "Recreation through recreating"

>You are given two strings A and B consisting of lowercase characters from the English alphabet. The maximum length of each string is 10^5.
>
>Your aim is to generate A by concatenating a minimum number of copies of B. Before concatenating a copy of string B you can choose to remove any number of characters from that copy.
>
>It is guaranteed that it is possible to create string A using a finite number of copies of string B in this way.
>
>Write a function that takes two strings A and B as inputs, and outputs the minimum number of copies of string B required to make string A.
