## 11 Down: "Squared away"

>John loves mathematics. Yesterday in school he learnt about square integers, and now he can't stop thinking about them. As a reminder, integer n is "square" if there exists some integer x such that n = x * x. At some point, John realises that some integers could be described as "almost-square". An integer is almost-square if it is square after one digit is removed.
