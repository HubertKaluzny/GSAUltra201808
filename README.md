# GSA Ultra 2018

This was a competition in July/August of 2018. I've copied all the questions and my answers to this repository.

I managed to get 8/13 of the answers correct and pass 39.76% of all the test cases and this was my first time writing more than 5 lines of code in Python. I only had a weekend to fully work through the competition properly whereas it took place between a Thursday and a Tuesday (inclusive).

Next time I would definitely take a day or two off work as I didn't get a chance to explore some solution fully.
